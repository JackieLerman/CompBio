X = position of an object 
V = Speed of the object
a = acceleration 

If constant speed is known(Linear):
    Distance = V*T(Time) 
    
real time speed(For a very small time):
    V = X'= dx/dt
    a = v' = x"
    
Approx speed:
    Change in x = V(t)* change in time 
    Change in speed = a * change in time
    


()= small below variable: 
    X(i+1) = x(i) + v(i) * dt 
    v(i+1) = v(i) + a * dt
